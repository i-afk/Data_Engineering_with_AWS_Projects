# Sparkify EtL Pipeline
#### Ian McDonough 

## AWS Project Aims
The aim of the this project is to build a scalable ETL pipeline which will take two tables from the media app "Sparkify", which are currently stored in S3, and convert them into 5 normalised tables stored in Amazon Redshift. The choice to store this data in third Normal Form (3NF) on Amazon Redshift will enable data analysis while making efficient use of storage resorces.
